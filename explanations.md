# Explanations about the project structure

"Explain to me your project as if I was a complete noob in programming."

I want to make a web application in C#.\
I choose to use **ASP.NET MVC structure**, a robust framework for developing modern web applications. This structure is clear and neat, and facilitates the apply of "separation of concerns" principle into my code, making it more maintenable and reliable.

Creating an MVC project comes with a predefined structure of files and folders. I will explain to you the purpose of each generic file.

## Properties folder
It is a folder containing **configuration files and settings** related to the development environment.

For example, it contains a `launchSettings.json`, which is a configuration file for project's basic settings and adjustments. As its name suggests it, its primary use is to specify how the application should be launched and debugged locally.\
It contains among other things informations about IIS (Internet Information Services) Express settings. **Application Settings**: specifies the .NET version in which the project is compiled.

## wwwRoot folder

## Models folder

## Views folder

## Controllers folder

## appSettings.json file

## Program.cs file
